**COVISURANCE** is a **Blockchain** based insurance platform to get instant **Premium Cover**.

# üî¥ Problem Statement:

Medical treatment is one of the major expenses in one‚Äôs life. Getting hospitalized brings with it a great financial need urgently. For this people invest in health insurance but in today‚Äôs scenario getting claims from the insurance companies have become a very time taking process. This problem has majorly scaled up during the Covid-19 situation. God-forbid, anyone gets Covid-positive there is an *urgent need for money* for tests, ambulance service, medication, oxygen etc. and even after demise, the family members must get their claims as soon as possible to continue their livelihood. 
**Our solution would increase the ease of getting health claims and greatly reduce the time span of the process for the wellbeing of the people.**

# üü° Idea Description:
- [x] We have used Blockchain to ***channelize the funds***. 
- [x] Through an easy to UI, the user will ***register*** on our online platform and submit the ***required documents*** to verify.
- [x] Then according to the user there will be ***plans based on the claims needed***. In this way the user will register and we start streaming the premium from their **Portis Wallet**. 
- [x] When the consumer is in need of funds he/she would have to upload the supporting documents to ***validate their fund*** needs. 
- [x] Once ***verified*** the funds will be ***immediately transferred*** to them using our solution deployed upon **Polygon Testnet**.
- [x] **Using Blockchain will make it possible to channelize funds without delay hence providing people with funds and helping them to get better treatment and better lives for their loved ones**.
