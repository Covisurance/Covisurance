# COVISURANCE
COVISURANCE is a Blockchain based insurance platform to provide health insurance against Covid-19 related issues.

# Problem Statement:
Medical treatment is one of the major expenses in one’s life. Getting hospitalized brings with it a great financial need urgently. For this people invest in health insurance but in today’s scenario getting claims from the insurance companies have become a very time taking process. This problem has majorly scaled up during the Covid-19 situation. God-forbid, anyone gets Covid-positive there is an urgent need for money for tests, ambulance service, medication, oxygen etc. and even after demise, the family members must get their claims as soon as possible to continue their livelihood. Our solution would increase the ease of getting health claims and greatly reduce the time span of the process for the wellbeing of the people.

# Idea Description:
We have used Blockchain to channelize the funds. Through an easy to user interface, the user will register on our online platform and submit the required documents to verify for the E-kyc. Then according to the user there will be plans based on the claims needed. In this way the user will register and we start streaming the premium from their metamask wallet. When the consumer is in need of funds he would have to upload the supporting documents to validate their fund needs. Once verified the funds will be immediately transferred to them using our solution deployed upon Polygon. Using Blockchain will make it possible to channelize funds without delay hence providing people with funds and helping them to get better treatment and better lives for their loved ones.

# Technology Stack and Working:
For web development HTML, CSS, JS, React, Firebase is used. For E-kyc, E-KYC API is implemented. Users can register and then login to add the necessary details.

For Document verification we have used Python along with it's OpenCV and Tesseract libraries. To test the code we have taken a random hospital bill from the internet. I have entered my name in the code that doesn't matches the name in the bill so ithe output shows "Documents doesn't match."

# Use Cases and Future scope:
Getting the best healthcare will be everyone’s aim even after this pandemic gets over. Presently our concern is to provide instant hassle-free health insurance against Covid-19. In future this Blockchain based health-insurance system can be deployed as a general model and help people getting their claims and enabling them to get the best treatment immediately.
